# React App

In this project, I implement  map app where anyone will be able to look for places in specific area in chicago. The google map API was used to get the center where there are many places to go to and to visit. The data for places and its categorizes were retrived from Foursquare Api. It will be easy to use icon for more popular places to visit in this area or enter what you want to look for. The categorizes are hard code, but the location are not. The locations were specified by Foursquare Api based on category I provide it and mark the location by google map App. Information about the place, its known-name, address if applicable will be provide as soon as you click on the place. The App is responsive design; it can be use on different devices.

[Instruction to run the code](#Instruction to run the code)

## Instruction to run the code:
 After creating the react app, there are node_modules have to be sure it is added (it install create-react-app and react-async-script-loader(this file will be installed separately, code will not run if it is not included)). 
Please note, Google Map API provide me key to use with limit tries to use google map API as well as foursquare api so any problem appears will be because key from google API and/or client Id and client server from foursquare api; just replace them to go ahead with your own keys.
