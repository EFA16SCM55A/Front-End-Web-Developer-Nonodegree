## Describing project:
This project is to design enjoyable game by matching the cards faster with less number of moves to get higher rate. The time will be count and every try of moving the card that is not matching will decrease the rate of the player's performance. Increasing number of moving the cards will decrease number of stars that player can get. There are 8 cards that need to be matched to win the game, but the result depends on number of moving, time used, rate of performance. The player can restart the game whenever the player wants. Also, the player can replay again after winning the game .
